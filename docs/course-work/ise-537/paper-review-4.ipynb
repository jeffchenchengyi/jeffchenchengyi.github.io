    "# Paper Review 4: Size Matters, if You Control Your Junk\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the paper reveals that the quality minus junk factor is a confounder in explaining the inconsistent return premia across time and firms of using size factor. Controlling for quality increases the consistency of return premia and eliminates the abnormal returns we see from using size as a factor.\n",

    "### Challenges to the size effect\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many papers find that the size effect is simply not very significant, producing only a small abnormal return and Sharpe ratio, with marginal statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Others have argued that the size effect has disappeared since the early 1980s when it was originally discovered and published (partly contributing to its overall weak effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The size effect appears to be concentrated among only the smallest, microcap stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Most of the returns related to size seem to occur in January, particularly the first few trading days of the year, and are largely absent the rest of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Following the original argument of Ball (1978), Berk (1995a) argues that because size is typically measured by market capitalization (price times shares outstanding), which contains market prices, any misspecification in the asset pricing model is likely to show up in a cross-sectional relation between size and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A host of papers argue and show that size may just be a proxy for a liquidity effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Size anomaly is weak and not very robust in international equity markets, and hence the size effect may possibly be the result of data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper shows that by controlling for quality, we get much more reliable size premiums."
