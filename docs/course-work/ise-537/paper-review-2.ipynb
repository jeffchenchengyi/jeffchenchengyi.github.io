    "Overall, Carry is defined in the paper as the portion of expected return of an asset assuming that current prices and market predictions of prices over time do not move - yield curve being constant for fixed income, forward curve being constant. It has shown to have extremely good risk-adjusted returns, especially in portfolios when we allocate equal volatility contribution from each asset class, long the high carry securities and short the low carry securities within each asset class. Simply by longing the high carry securities and shorting the low carry securities within each asset class at each mopnth-end produces great returns for equities, fixed-income, and currencies, but a different signal Carry1-12, the 12 month moving average of Carry, performs better for highly seasonal asset classes such as commodities. Carry also has very low exposure to the market, though it is highly exposed to macro-economic conditions.\n",
