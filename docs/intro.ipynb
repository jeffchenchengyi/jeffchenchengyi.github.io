    "Obviously, in order to succeed in life (\"succeed\" could be in the context of anything -- e.g. healthy relationships, career, financial, academics, ...) without relying on purely luck, one needs to have the bare minimum drive and resolve to want to work hard and actually execute it. But what does it mean to work hard? What does it mean to **really** understand the material that you're learning? Clearly, the first step would be to start learning about what you know you don't know. However, if you're **only** doing this, you might get the false sense of confidence that brings you up to the Peak of \"Mount Stupid\" as shown in the figure above. To get to the \"Plateau of Sustainability\", one has to trudge forward to find out what one doesn't know one doesn't know, i.e. the unknown unknowns. I'll be using this space to demonstrate times when I've tried to push past the area of known unknowns through asking questions that drive me to the unknown unknowns. "

Overall, my interests lie in the realm of probabilistic machine learning because it provides a framework for both learning about unbobserved variables as well as a good measure of uncertainty for predictions. “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher M. Bishop is the best textbook resource I could find for learning about probabilistic machine learning. "

    "If you're not familiar with the NFL Theorem, it basically states that there isn't a single \"best\" machine-learning / optimization algorithm for any problem. We often here of how most ML practitioners have a favourite algorithm that they turn to, almost like a silver bullet, for any given machine learning problem such as tree-based ensembling models like XGBoost or LightGBM. After building ML systems for trading strategies at [Plutus Mazu](https://www.plutusmazu.com/), I've become truly humbled by the implications of this theorem. A tree-based ensembling model might work exceptionally well on a large dataset, but with very little data, the most regularized tree-based ensembling model still fails catastrophically during cross-validation as compared to a simple unscaled, KNN for example. Speaking of which, I think this theorem also generalizes to data preprocessing techniques as I've seen that applying scaling for example, is not necessarily always beneficial, especially when you're using an algorithm that computes the distance between features of samples such as KNN, KMeans, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, my priors on AutoML have shifted much more positively. Well, then what's the point of hiring a data scientist then? From my knowledge so far, I think that AutoML systems have yet to become \"smarter\". There's an unimaginably huge search space of models to be used in the machine learning pipeline -- which missing data imputer? which dimensionality reduction technique? which scaler to use? which feature selection algorithm? which machine learning algorithm?... There's probably a way to \"bayesianify\" (use bayesian optimization to search over ML models) the AutoML process once we figure out a way to measure similarily across ML techniques on different types of datasets. \n",
