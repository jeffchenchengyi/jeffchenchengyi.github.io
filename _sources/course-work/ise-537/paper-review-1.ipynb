    "# Paper Review 1: Value and Momentum Everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Chengyi (Jeff) Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "Asness, Moskowitz, Pedersen attempt to identify and examine the latent factors and correlation structure behind factors used in value and momentum factors that produce significant risk premia across markets and asset classes. Furthermore, using a combination of both the value and momentum strategies within each market and asset class proved to have the highest sharpe ratios overall. They also discovered that even though value and momentum strategies produced positive returns, they are negatively correlated. They explained this phenomenon as a result of a link to funding liquidity risk, and not market liquidity risk. In Section 4 of the paper, they also performed a time-series regression of the returns of each of the 48 portfolios they have created out of their pool of asset classes across markets (ranked by value or momentum, weighted by beginning-of-month market capitalization for stocks and equal weights for non-stocks) on the market portfolio returns (MSCI Index), and equal-volatility-weighted across asset-class value and momentum factors. This global three-factor model explained that the returns to value and momentum across markets and asset classes much better than local U.S. factors can, suggesting that global value and momentum portfolios across markets and asset classes are closer to the efficient frontier than U.S. stock-only value and momentum portfolios, and therefore provide a more robust set of asset pricing factors that can be used more broadly. Overall, the primary takeaway from this paper is that using a combination of momentum and value factors, across a range of asset classes and markets, possibly adding in funding liquidity measures such as TED spreads could potentially create a low idiosyncratic risk, high alpha portfolio."
